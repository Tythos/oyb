Oy vey! So many orbit models. Here's another one.

Largely based on Howard Curtis' excellent text, *Orbital Mechanics for
Engineering Students," second edition. Contains the minimum components needed to
model and propagate restricted two-body orbits, with time values leveraging the
core Python module *datetime*.
