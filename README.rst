Oy vey! So many orbit models. Here's another one.

Largely based on Howard Curtis' excellent text, *Orbital Mechanics for
Engineering Students," second edition. For the most part, each module captures
algorithms from a unique chapter. Examples are frequently used to define unit
tests in the *test* folder, also organized by module/chapter.

Linear algebra framework is provided by numpy.
